- Some benchmarks to run Heptane, subset of the MÃ¤lardalen WCET Benchmarks,
  http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/projects/wcet/benchmarks.html

- annot.h  uses to manage specific annotations of Heptane...

- ARMLIB.h contains redefinitions of some functions for ARM. 
  If the standart library libgcc is used for the linking. At the heptane analysis step, the following abort occurs (for example with the expint axample):
   | Cfg does not have endnodes, cfg __divsi3 __aeabi_idiv
   | Going on, ...
   | HeptaneAnalysis: src/Handle.cc:97: void cfglib::Handle::resolveHandles(): Assertion `id_serialisable.count(currentID)!=0' failed.
   | Abort (core dumped)

st benchmark

The st.c requires some specific libraries:
   * libm for ARM and MIPS, 
   * libc for ARM and MIPS,
   * and libgcc for ARM.

So the config file must have the informations of the address of these libraries, for example
   <LINKER NAME="../../CROSS_COMPILERS/MIPS/bin/mips-ld" OPT="-L../../CROSS_COMPILERS/MIPS/mips/lib" SCRIPT="" LIBS= " -lc -lm" />

Currently for ARM the libraries are not added. The entry points are redefined in ../ARMlib.h (see above).
